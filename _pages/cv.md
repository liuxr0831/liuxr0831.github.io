Research Experiences
======
* 8/2023 - Current: PhD Student, Cornell University
  * Advisor: Abe Davis
  * Researching VR/AR interaction, eye tracking, spatial audio, and applications of image-based rendering in content creation interactions.

* 5/2021 - 8/2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin-Madison
  * Supervisor: Prof. Ari Rosenberg and Dr. Byounghoon Kim
  * Helped in developing custom eye tracking system and analyzing eye tracking data for nonhuman primates based on Pupil Lab's wearable eye tracker. 
  * Conducted research sessions involving a visual search task with autistic kids, built the pipeline to pre-process and filter eye tracking data, and analyzed eye tracking data.
  

* 5/2021 - 8/2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin-Madison
  * Supervisors: Prof. Matthew I. Banks and Prof. Barry Van Veen
  * Implemented the Sequential Multistate Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (SM-MVAR) clustering algorithm, a k-mean-like algorithm where the likelihood measure is the “distance metric,” and MVAR model estimation is the “center re-estimation.” Used SM-MVAR to study consciousness of human brain using brain electrophysiological data during sleep and anesthesia.
