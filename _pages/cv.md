Work and Research Experiences
======
* 5/2021 - 8/2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * University of Wisconsin-Madison
  * Helped in developing custom eye tracking system and analyzing eye tracking data for nonhuman primates based on Pupil Lab's wearable eye tracker. Conducted research sessions involving a visual search task with autistic kids, built the pipeline to pre-process and filter eye tracking data, and analyzed eye tracking data.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Ari Rosenberg

* 5/2021 - 8/2023: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * University of Wisconsin-Madison
  * Implemented the Sequential Multistate Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (SM-MVAR) clustering algorithm, a k-mean-like algorithm where the likelihood measure is the “distance metric,” and MVAR model estimation is the “center re-estimation.” Used SM-MVAR to study consciousness of human brain using brain electrophysiological data during sleep and anesthesia.
  * Supervisors: Prof. Matthew I. Banks and Prof. Barry Van Veen
